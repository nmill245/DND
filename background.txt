My Clan <insert clan name> travelled the outer spaces of the Oligarchy. As we travelled and I got more involved with the clan I was sent out to talk to the townsfolk for food and supplies during these trips I fell in love with the academics around every turn During this sudden lust for knowledge, truth, logic, and reason, I slowly felt myself distancing from my clan. They have always been focused on connecting with each other and learning, but I wanted deeper truths, more truths. I found myself sneaking out to interact with townsfolk more and more, until eventually I got introduce to my first meeting with <THE GOD>. This only awakened my thirst more, and gave me a path forward with this knowledge. I still continued travelling with my clan but everytime we stopped I sought out the temple and the meetings regarding <THE GOD>. My clan was getting worried, and started doing everything they could to keep me with them to no avail. Eventually the tension boiled over and I went to stay with other followers. From there I met my best friend. They were the ones to support me when I was copperless and alone. They helped me truly find <THE GOD> and was around when my clerical powers started to appear. They coached me on how to be the best cleric I can and are who got me into adventuring overall. This friend is my newest connection, but I do still have a connection to my clan and wish them the best. There are moments where I try to seek out where they are and what they are doing, but I have forgotten the travelling paths of old, and it seems they have new travelling paths after I left.
