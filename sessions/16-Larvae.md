## Ritual Room
- There is a room with braziers with red flame much like from the Gildergleam although this is coming from butane in the wall.
- There is a sargaphogus in the middle end of the room with a language that none of us can recognize
- Fizbit finds no traps and tracks within this chamber
- Fizbit can't tell if this is the same type of flame as Scarlet Ash Tree Flames. Merrick can tell that it is the same exact type of flames
- Markings go from the brazier to the container
- Container does not seem locked but you must slide off the top
- The container in the center is not a coffin, but is built for holding an object. Is not ornemental / dectrative. Is a very purposeful creation.
- The entire area feels concecrated but whatever is in the box seems neutral at best / worst. It does not have good or evil per se.
- Feel strong feelings of concecration from the braziers. There is a celestial warmth radiating off of them.
- Getting an omen regarding openning the box and taking whatever is inside.
    - Wheel and Woe: 
        - Good and Bad can come from this... There is an innate curiosity attached to the Wheel and the Woe. The Divine is curious with what we would do with whats in it.
    Dance, Entice, Orbit, Dance, Dance
        - Look forward and all of the braziers are situated such that I would be a connection of a ring of fire
        - Whatever is in there is really really old
- We have decided to at least open the box
- As the inside of the box get illumiated, the inscriptions on the lid die down. We peer inside to see a square shaped chamber.
- There are various different lines and markings, almost circutry. Going to the central cubic chamber which lies a small grub. There is a long dead larve curled up in a death pose.
- Powerful magical dead larvae
- Merrick and Fizbit attempt to figure out what is going on with this larvae
- The history check is aided by Mekhane... the larvae is older than the age of humanity, like humans as a concept. Likely back to the Age of the Titans.
- Fizbit finds there is some scales that relates to only one thing... dragons
- The runes at the top of the box stay weak...
- No one has the ability to understand the language around us
- Fizbit finds that the corners of the room seem to have multiple versions of them
- The larvae is almost stone like. It is rather heavy in terms of importance.
- The larvae is about the size of a human infant
- Val starts to cook the larvae but the fire does not pervade into the larvae and Val's hands are protected
- Val gives Merrick the larvae
- Something smiles as we leave
- It is connected to Aria ... again but once again Merrick knows nothing about Aria. Will need to find ways to learn more

## Leaving the Ritual Room

- Rope is 20 ft to our right / we are 20 ft left of it
- If we are to go and find info about the larvae, it is a seperate quest line type thing
