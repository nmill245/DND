    - "What, then, is an Aether Shard? We may declare it no mere mineral. It is a bead of collision, where primal Chaos hammers against the lattice of Order, the impact caught in stasis. Each Shard is less a jewel than a battery, a cell in which corruption itself has been preserved like a fossil. It is an object driven not by design but by entropy, a knot of instability caged within an accidental cage.
    - Within these crystalline hosts appear structures of a perplexing nature, filaments and fissures, web-like spindles that no quarrying tool nor geological pressure could yield. I name their makers the Spindrels: fell artificers not of stone but of fracture. Their webs are not the residue of creation but its sabotage, for they appear where order meets strain, where structure is forced to bear what it cannot. They are parasites upon the concept of stability itself, never shaping from nothing but always prying at what already exists.
    - My department endeavored to test whether these webs were mere accident. We subjected several lesser Shards to stress-experiments. Heat, cold, and the projection of ordered arcana. In each case, the fractures re-aligned, not randomly but in forms eerily consistent, reasserting the same arachnid geometries even as the surface was reshaped. More troubling still, those who worked closest to the specimens reported dreams of voices beyond the veil, corroding and tempting in tongues no mortal tongue speaks"
    - "If these webs are indeed their work, then every Shard is not treasure but wound: a scar where our realm has been gnawed by jaws unseen. What we call the Aether Shard is, in truth, a frozen glimpse of the battlefield between Order and Chaos, a cross-section of the war from which our world was born. To study them is peril, to use them is folly, for what parasite allows its host to thrive forever?‚Äù Editor's note: The usage of Shard Technology is entirely safe. - Ministry of Rosehaven.
