## Recouping after Minecraft

- Maybe we don't head East... the undead are scary
- Gust will do the second watch, Val will do last watch
- Fizbit makes a new Steel Defender now
- We decide to just continue East for 2 hours to get to the town

## Travel to the town

- There is a fort covered in mist on our way to the town
- A plague is happening in the town and the door is locked
- They don't have room for "strangers"
- "Is there anything we can help with?" - Gust. "We have food however, I don't think a group of strangers can help us much, unless we can find the source"
- Fizbit hears a weird clucking noise in the city
- Gust turns into a spider and climbs into the town to try and figure out what is happening
- Finds a painted on houses with "danger" as well other information, and hears some talking
- Housing is molding and there is a thick fog through the streets, Gust crawling forward as a spider
- Gust crawls through the window as a spider
- Gust finds very "old" looking people that are not old at all
- Gust sees swept up feathers
- Finding evidence that the "plague" turns people into birds
- Gust starts leaving and hears a scream as he gets something thrown at him
- "Everything is above your paygradee"
- Detect magic is being casted through the door
- Curse vs Affliction -> Curse is able to be seen by detect magic. Afflictions are not. And afflictions are non-reversable. Diseases are cureable, curse is able to be stopped.
    - Afflictions can not spread

## Travel back to Dalehurst

- Gust is getting shot at and gets hit in the back with an icicle and Gust feels cold.
- Winged and horned creature dives into the chasm below
- Happens right outside Grammestead
- Fearsome and territorial... Frost Drake
- We run away

## Back to Dalehurst

- Caravan is gone... uh oh
- Head to the townmaster tower
- Townmaster tower "Do not go in; Danger"
- Yelling out to the townmaster tower but no one stops to talk to us
- People are ignoring us as they walk by
- The mines are erupting
- The Kobolds are out on the streets
- Help the Dragonborn healer move all their stuff to the caravan at the guild hall and Torbin is at the guild hall too
- Torbin is wearing a fur coat while working
- Dalehurst will head to Minthala and then further beyond
- Caravan came in a bithile freeloading. Gave them good traffic and trade. They are a weapons shipment from the West

## Back to Grammestead
- Gust hears some claws below but they do not seem to be caring about us... yet
- Gust screams at Drake's and they shoot out icicles back at Gust, one hitting Gust
- Fizbit and Val get the smell of something burning
- They are burning bodies
- Mutate into golem like creatures. They get claws and become feral and attack.
- There are things lurking around at night similar to them
- Given the name of "Screechers". Unsure of the source / transmission
- Detect Poison and Disease finds me Corvus Sanguinus - Bloodborne illness. Takes root in bone marrow. Infection based mixing of bodily fluids
    - 3 Stages:
        - 1 : Accuracte (skin irritation, goose bumps, and pinning) 
        - 2 : Grey eyes, nasal cartalidge shifting
        - 3 : Predatory reshaping
- Corvus Sanguinus - A proper medical name for a disease coming from the root words for corvid (crows), Sanguinus = Blood
- Geoffrey helps us with this
- Town lost their cattle - they had started ripping each other to shreds and eating each other
- Mayor died... Singular Martial is the leader
- Sounds like a form of therianathropy (Lycanthropy, etc.). Were-ravens, Were-crows, Were-beasts type things. Both a disease and then evolves into an affliction
- Werewolves and demons have a silver weakness -> They don't reduce damage unlike with other forms of damage
- We will be helping Grammestead with their were-bird problem
- Martial = Serigal
- We sort through the guards finding how is sick and who isnt
- We get a front row seat to the transformed were-crow... very very scary beings. They don't seem to fly (yet)
- 3-4 pack hunters
