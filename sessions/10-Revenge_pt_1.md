## Val Perspective

- Val feels a cold in her bones. 
- A soul out in the wilderness alone. 
- The jaws of life closing around her.
- Val feels a breeze that is not warm or kind, but does exist...
- Val is being warmed but far away from the enterance, there is a wind pulling her back into the snow... not to safety
- Sees a 4 eyed being that feeds on your meaning not your life... Nods once at you as a hunters respect.
- Val awakens and is chained to a mast, the heat of a real fire licking at her skin. The cold seems more comforting than the heat at this point
- Val is in a smallish chamber that is held up by wooden supports. Near some hay / grass while chained against a mast stuck into the ground and ceiling.
- There are two other individuals with her, an elderly man with grey robes and a auburn haired woman with grey streaks that does not have their mouth bound.
- There are 2 Kobolts on watch next to the fire, not really watching Val though but rather prodding at food.
- Both are beaten and not looking great... Val has her arms behind her chained. The mans mouth is bound.
- Val asks the other girl what is going on, the other girl does not really respond.
- Val has been looted, the armor has been removed as well as her pouch and bag
- No one has cold weather gear on
- Val sees her stuff in a chest across the room
- She (the other woman) is tied but also seems to be caged around her torso. No chance of escape
- Val sees skulls and bones littering the floor
- Val gets some food from the fire... and gets some other pieces tossed to her as she is a little circus for them.
- Winged Kobold murderes one of the guards

## Everyone else

- Gust is spiked at -21 hp in a bit. If gust is removed from the spike... he will no longer be stable. Nail needs two hands to climb
- Spike is half a foot thick made of stone
- Nail pulls gust off the rock... and then uses a bonus action to stabilize him again
- Fizbit and Merrick are playing guard as we attempt to rescue Gust
- Nail keeps the money, dagger, flower pin, card set, healers kit, and a piece of jewlery...
- Nail is fast af... running away from everyone.
- We (Merrick) kills two Kobolts as we run away to heal Gust in the sort of landing space before the cavern.
- Using cure wounds and healers kit to attempt to heal gust... so close but also not there yet
- Fizbit is the one to finally heal him to completion

## Recouping
- Gust is alive again... although feeling awful and everything feels crunchy
- Gust saw the afterlife. Gust is missing everything he needs to cast goodberry... or most any spell for that matter
- Gust is held together by magic mostly tbh, although he is sitting up and standing a bit... his knee is very crunchy though
- Attempting to generate another plan to go save Val. Gust may use a construct to do the thing
- Gust creates a little spider construct thing that crawls out of his hair and resting in his hand
- Spider construct scouts for us... looking for Gusts items and Kobolds
- Spider finds more Kobolds... great great, at least we think as much... honestly unsure if spider knows what a Kobold is
- Need to create a plan for Val
- The person who saved us when rabbit hunting is here to help maybe again (Witch Hunter)
- Tells us to help Gust get his stuff cause ... oops
- Gust scouts ahead and checks the Kobolds with the spider
- The witch hunter is attempting to help us out and opens a locked journal that we can not read
- There are diagrams of snakes, dragons, lizards, and humanoid hybrids.
- Witch hunter will not be following / helping us... but does advise us
- Warning: "If you go down there, then you have to be smarter than them, think like them"
- "You (Fizbit) start thinking like an engineer, they will have so many traps. They are planning on how to kill us"
- "You (Nail), you will be the one to go through first for hand activated traps. Beware of line of sight and start hiding once you can hear. Trigger them as fast as possible"
- Rolls a bottle towards Fizbit although it is "not from him"
- Said "Mayor" not "Townmaster"
- 2 at our entrance, mutiple at the other entrance... plus traps and others
- One above Winged... there are a good amount of Kobolds just around
- Gust has cursed thorns inside him... uh oh
## Combat pt. 2
- Combat ensues as we now have a better idea on how to fight Kobolts
- Nail stole Gusts dagger... Gust will remember this betrayal
