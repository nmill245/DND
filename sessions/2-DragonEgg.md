# In Town
After awakening in the Tavern, the group speaks with the Pixie. The pixie says very little, being scared, before falling asleep and being cold yet again.
There are two options:
    - Traveling to Tree [Gildergleam] (10-20 miles 2 days travel) unknown / no pay (Geoffrey Simons, In Town (Has a house in the SE)). Not exact location. No Main Roads. Towards town of Lastar. No time limit / time expected. Came in Last Week
    - Deliver Cart to an Individual to Minthala (Noble Heric Thorn, Not in Town ... There is a contact in town [Dennis, South part of Town in a boarding house]). Start within a week (A days travel w/ cart). Paid Labour 15GP / person. Came in Last Night
    If we go Cart -> Tree (3 days)
Ask the barkeep for more details, large barkeep that is very strong. Unpin the Tasks and walk up the barkeep to ask
Blacksmith on the West Side of Town
Gust hands over eggs for our breakfast
Fizbit goes to the general store (center of town) with Val ? to the blacksmith     
The other three go South to Dennis and then East to Geoffrey

# Val and Fizbit Shop (Unknown to ME)
They enter with mechanical "dog", find an old woman with grey hair. Fizbit wants Cartography supplies (Paper and ink)

Red Glow comes off of the platinum as the Old Woman grabs the Plat coin. She rolls the coin and then makes it disappear
Val inquires about Healer's kits (7.5 GP each). Not needed at all tbh so we just move on. Can refill a charge for 6 SP. Bought One Charge.
There is a handaxe for sale... comes in a pair of handaxes 15 GP for the handaxes
# The Others
Head south to Dennis' Board House. Find it easily. A well built establishment, has a small lobby
The attendent squints at us ... finds us shady (I am not persuasive)
Nail holds the attendent at knife point... attempting to make them talk. Very intimidating
Dennis is in room 4 from Nail... we travel to Room 4.
We knock on the door, takes a bit but a man answers the door.
Thorn needs supplies to Minthala; "No degredation of the Samples". Payment after from the Noble Heric Thorn.
Dennis wants to come with us on the entire trip... but is almost ready to crack.
Dennis wants to come with... wearing rags and grabs brass knuckles to hold his own as we travel.
Takes us to an inconstruction stable that has mules and a cart. Samples of Stone and Soil in cart. There is also a locked tome
# Val and Fizbit Blacksmith (Unknown to ME)
Edwins blacksmith and good
Val looks for a handaxe. Finds a singular handaxe of good quality with a full tang of metal, good for woodcutting as well. 8 GP for handaxe

Fizbit looks for something... anything... (Martial weapon) that is cheap. Finds a BattleAxe...

Heads to the Plaza
# The others in the SE
Found the house of Geoffrey, a recently built log cabin / house. There is a wooden door.
Gust knocks on the door, a handsome man shows up. Offers us inside for the fire.
We enter, its a quaint little place with a large black bear rug, and a couch in front of the fire.
We all lean in as he leans forward and whispers about the Gildergleam. His family is attacked to it, and the tree has been sickly.
Had to move from the tourist town as it was failing because of the sick tree.
Wife wants to move on and abandon the tree, Geoffrey wants to solve the issues regarding the tree... he is superstitioius of something injuring / sapping it.
Shadow of what it once was... if it would be possible to save the tree and move back in. Unsure on the solution...
With a success he digs up the old heirloom and gift it to us. Or point us in the direction of a MAGICAL ITEM to BRING BACK THE DEAD
Gifted us 3 10 lb bags of fertilizer, a location, and a description of the tree.
Different regional myths and legends, such as the Gildergleam. Exists everywhere and everyplace. There is most likely significance though.
He also gifts us a sending stick so we can communicate with him when we are done.
We get the cart and travel to the plaza to meet up with Fizbit and Val
# Meetup / Get ready to go
We rehash.
Need to head West to Minthala for the escort, then heading through the Forest for Gildergleam
# Travel
Move West, finding rolling hills covered in snow. The "Frontier", unknown / unmapped. Egglander Peaks are the largest Mountain Range that we can just barely see.
Moving away from the Goldbreach Mountain Range a subset of the Egglander Peaks. The Goldlander Mountain is the one that we were at the foot of for the King's Hand
Nothing ominous happens.
A white rock falls from the sky and hits Val... knocking them out from first watch
# Scary Rock
Large Scary Rock causing fire, is styrofoam esque... it falls apart leaving a patterned teardrop. As we examine, we find that it is natural but unsure what else.
I find out from a strange preminition that this is from the outershell of something cracking with a singular eye looking in. The edges of the inner core are scaled.
Its difficult to identify when found because it is near impossible to distinguish from stone, but this is a dragon egg.
It is glowing and on fire. It is lighting the roots under the earth like dynamite. Throwing water makes the water turn to dust.
It also melts dirt... 
Fizbit takes a rest as we realize the egg is cooling pretty quickly
# Chase
We get chased and attacked by some Black Guard Drakes. Val and Nail must run away and meet up with us at camp, scooping the egg in the process.
As running away a drake catches up we enter combat, we win. Overall fun combat experience.
# Making it to town
We get checked by the guards and convince them we don't have a dragon egg. Make it town okay
We are able to keep the egg and make it into the city.
Commune of Thalgorath would take a dragon egg in the black market, dangerous to get to though
