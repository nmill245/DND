## Finding the Troll

- Massive Green Skinned Troll -> Standing in front of the bridge.
- Unable to cross without going through them
- Focused attention towards the 'right' behind an empty and abandoned tollhouse
- Suprise at a troll speaking in common -> Can't beat the troll in a fight
## Trolls

- This troll does know common and simply stands at the start of the bridge

## Confronting the Troll

- "Who is we" - T (getting angry)
- "Gust, Fizbit, Val" - Gust
- "All who seek passage must answer my question, if failed to answer will be meal" - T
- Val left alone, must answer the question. Right next to the troll
- "I will ask a question, you must answer, you get 3 attempts"
- "I have cities but no houses, I have mountains but no trees, I have water but no fish, what am I?" - T
- "A map" - V (The correct answer)
- Val gets across easily
- Fizbit attempts next
- "I speak without a mouth, I hear without ears, I have no body but I come alive in the wind, what am I?" - T (Answer: Echo(
- Hint given but at cost of bringing chance to 1
- "You often hear me in caves or canyons, but youll never see me"

- Gust proceeds to walk across the ice as a cat with the chicken
- Nail runs across the bridge, moving fast af
- Troll jumps and crashes into water as everyone runs across the bridge
- Gets chased by troll, everyone is able to outrun them before they can catch up 

## Freedom

- Troll still looks for us as we hide away.
- Nail is frozen Solid, given a blanket from Fizbit and Gust's flame. unable to fully heat him up though
- Group looks for cave / clearing for shelter from the wind
- Gust found a hidden cavern in the NE in the roots of trees out of permafrost dirt -> Can get trapped in cave
- Merrik (I) find a bowl shape to allow ease of fire creation -> Not able to see out but people can see in
- Merrik finds wood with help from Fizbit to create fire while we travel to the cavern -> There is a pile of prepared wood outside the cave covered in snow
- Able to stay for 2 hours with the wood we have

## Cave

- Enter cave in the footholes of dirt
- Stumble upon a boot in the cave... that is attached to something or someone
- Found 2 (dead) halflings in the cave.
- One with good armor, one without, surrounding a long extinguished fire
- Val digs 2 graves for the halflings
- Fizbit scouts the cave and does not find anything, nor signs of life in the cave
- The bodies stay together except for the head and the hands, clothing keeping it together
- Everyone else lights a fire using the tinderbox supplied by Val
- Snuff out fire, leaving the cave

## Quest Info

- Fizbit investigating the map to find where we are and where we need to go
- Able to deduce where we are on the map, considering we are near the main road
- Attempting to find the Kings Hand, which is cursed. Hand carrying a chalice, which brings bad fortune to those near / holding it. Very bad fortune
- A few days travel for the whole trip, day trip there, day trip back 
- Goldbreach Mountains Outside a forest (which may house wolves)
- Quest has been available for a month or 2

## Traveling

- Main road vs off road (45 minutes to an hour for main road, 3 hours for off road)
- Fitzbit and Gust argue about owing Gold, Gust says its 10, Fitzbit says it is 9 after going first for the bridge in the cave and while walking. 
- When leaving the cave, I see an artic fox get eaten by an animal.
- Later learn it is an armored artic wolf (proper leather armor)
- Leaving after seeing this... running away forever
- Val with Fitzbit joining them travel on the main road whereas the rest travel not on the road
- Val and Fitzbit meander (walking at half speed) while we travel
- 1:45 of travel later, nothing seems to have happening
- Come across a cliff face with a stream, make it to clearing with a sled

## Broken Pass

- Broken sled found, Fitzbit invesigates while the others simply surround the sled.
- With the investigation it can be noted that this was done by people, and natural causes.
- Finding footprints along the cavern wall. Ending with an indent in the snow and faint red in the otherwise white snow
- Drag marks into the woods that then end abruptly
- Untouched loot within the sled
- 200 lbs of fabric (Carpet) that are very fine / rich
- Could sell for a large amount of gold to the average commoner
- The entire sled is 110 GP, not easily transportable
- Each carpet is 40 lbs that are unwieldy.
- Sled is damaged (Front Left spoke snapped), the front is otherwise damaged
- Arrow marks but no arrows
- Shiny stuff found near the drap marks
- Chance to come back for loot... considering it has been here for potentially months
- 5 sets of footprints convering on a spot of blood

## Shiny Thing

- There appears to be a dire and malicious intent beneath the snow.
- A thing smiling "behind" me... just outside my vision
- It is the kings hand and chalice!! we found it!
- Known by name
- Influences fate with a divine nature (celestial, fiend, or other)
- Don't know if it is consecrated or desecrated
- Could be cursing those that aren't meant to hold it, but seems unlikely
- Connection to "The Fate" which is connected to "The Weave" -> The origin of magic
- Influences and connects to "The Fate"
- Small and able to be held in hands
- Gust attempts to pick up the shiny thing, bends down
- Puts both hands out, the width of the chalic and hand, clamping around it and grabs it.
- Found 3 shadow figures... that are terrifying with a sword, a hammer, and a spear thing
- The people are gone, the feeling is not
- Chalice makes everyone feel uneasy, must stay together
- Influences fate check to cause worse fates

## Travel Pt. 2

- Run away from the groto, run up the river.
- Find a very small boat for 2 people to cross
- Satachel in the boat that is frozen solid.
- Found cut rope in the boat
- Small creature would have difficulty, tiny creature is fine, medium creature may have problems... (50/50)
- Continue North
- Odd blue ice chunk -> Strange Lizard thing
- River gets thin enough for rope to be tied to either side of the river on trees
- Gust heard a noise of a "sigh" and is taking it as a sign that we should make a decision 
- Tie the rope and cross the river that is hanging in the middle, ergo not taut
- Fitzbit travels river first, huge crack bisects the center from his walking 
- Gust is walking and the ice gives out beneath him... His strength fails him and the rope slips out of his hand
- Gust pulls himself from the river, Val unties the rope and is able to grab said rope
- Moves up the river... rope tied exactly the same.
- In line of sight are the holes from last time
- Nail and Merrick make it along fine
- Val travels across... cracks begin to from while they reach the end of the river
- Fitzbit unties his rope, and finds wood to use for fire
- The group heads out after the 10 minutes to travel back to the town immediately

## Travel Pt. 3

- Head back to the main road, down river
- Travel at night for 1.5 hours... yay
- Ready for... fights, yay

## The fight

- A wolf made of shadow, drooling shadow standing in our way
- Likely tied to the hand and fates
- Omen to block paths a "Hound of Fate"
- -> Warning not strict threat
- Can cause death by fear
- Stood still for 15 minutes... dog got bigger
- Moving towards dog? No.
- Circling around the dog... maybe
- Doggo does not seem to care and disappears as we circle to head into the town North instead of West
- No other omens appear as we travel into town with the chalice
- Finding a rough clothed, round hat, begger. They are sitting next to a fire. Seems to be jovial.
- Gust hears a snort / sigh
- Val blacks out... an individual raises a toast to me.
- A man with a crown and a wicked smile raises a chalise to us
- "A toast, to your continued prosperity" - Shadow King thing
- The man and the fire disappears

## Town

- We get to town... and able to find the tavern.
- The individual is passed out who wants to buy the crown
- The individual is a drunkard who is having problems...
- We see the 62 GP and count it. Only 61 is given and they only have 50 more gold to give us.
- Attempting to haggle him to 105 GP
- Given 105 GP for the chalice... we are gifted all but 3 GP from him
- Sleeping at the tavern... and resting

## The Bag

- Fairy -> A Fairy ... the reason for the sighs and snorts
- Strange Needle (transmutation) (Fitzbit) -> It is magicial but an attunement item. The effects are unknown to all. Fitzbit unattunes after attuning, unsure of what powers. A sick joke by prior spell casters.
- Likely a reference to Cycles Fiedelm. Cult of the old wolf / order to wolf knights. Set of Winter wolves. Abhores the undead. Focused on life and death
- Do not get in conflict with them...it will be bad for eternity
- Spell Scroll of Jump (Given to Fitzbit) -> Able to learn how to jump. Black steel ring with Blue Rabbit
    - Ring of Jumping (Gust) -> Can cast jump as BA at will
