# Stick Escapades
Attempting to transfer Magic Fire out of the Temple... much harder than we first thought
Grey sticks seem to do it. These grey sticks are deadfall of the scarlet ash tree.
Scarlet Ash Tree (Known for Spiritual Properties = Has Blood):
    - Pink / Red Sap (Compared to Blood)
    - Grey / Grey Green Bark
Found some more sticks and and a log of the Scarlet Ash Tree -> Can create a torch from it.
Made a torch pretty good!! LETS GOOOO
We make it down, Nail accidently looks up and gets spooked.
We find a thorn and burn it. The thorn trys to like run away from the burning, seemingly hurt / upset
continue finding thorns until there is a space that the dog does not want to travel.
We take the torch away and let those with darkvision look in. Vale looks in and almost gets frightened but is okay thanks to fizbit Heroism
Vale then proceeds to take the torch from Nail and burn all the thorns over here.
Seemingly pig bodies also there... as the thorns continue to get torched.
Kill the above land roots pretty well... although Vale takes a beating for it.
Got the final bag of fertilizer planted.

# Finishing of the quest
4:23 minutes happen and then we get the location of the heirloom after breaking the sending stick.
Location of the Heirloom is in the childrens bedroom under the floorboards in the square building
Underneath the floorboards what is found is:
    A box:
    - Forged Silver Haircomb in the shape of vines cradling a sunburst, etched with a dedication. "'To warmth everlasting', Erenora the last warden of the tree" (125 GP) Heirloom.

Taking time for a rest at the tree. Fixing up the shrines door, making it very pretty and precious.
Cozy little sleepover in a shrine near the GilderGleam
Spotted a humanoid figure in a witches hat with glowing eye (right eye)... picking skin out of their nails. They smile / smirk at Vale. They fall behind a branch and disappear

# Travel
Stop into grandmas house... seems to be trouble and we hear a bell ringing
Frosty footprints + bell = Myth of the region. There are entities that lurk in frozen mist. 
One is known to hold a bell and signal locations of individuals out late at night... unsure why they appear.
Categorized as hunters in the mist. We don't know if the myths gave them as spirits or real beings / organization / faction
Group of "entities" (mist dwellers) that appear and take individuals. sometimes murdering entire individuals. They leave frosty footprints whereever they go.

# Dalehurst
Stone and wood buildings in the little village we travel to. The town (Dalehurst) has a colorful and bright sign telling us so. It is a very lively and chipper town.
Man jumps off a wagon to greet us. There are plenty of inns to check in to. Jobs are to be found but must go door to door.
The first tavern we visit is called "The Lazy Hero". Eating beans at the tavern with some wagons already at the tavern. (Two Story Inn)
Labourers are in the tavern and wave to us. Go into the inn and get some food. 
Meet some drunkards, the entire tavern is drunk af. Fizbit is the only one to eat at the tavern
Dwarven person kicks the door in. Town Master Greylan, "quite well off in this town". Looking to expand and renovate the town
This is a commune. Town Master is not elected but rather the founder of the town.
