# The Lazy Hero

Staying at a tavern talking to Greylan the town master; Excited for us to work and we are the honored guest of a festival.
The town is supposedly prosporous and they will pay us for our work for the town. We seem stuck because there is a blizzard.
The bartender is the only person so far not in a chipper mood - unethusiastic
Festival of the suns longevity <- hoping to end blizzard / bring back more of the sun
Nail is gonna flake (ofc he is)
Responsibilities of the honored guests -> Show up (Its for show)
Dalehurst has been around for 7-8 years
Tavern has rooms ? Has some open but not a lot of opportunity for sleep
Tavern Master can't complain about Dalehurst -> 6 years in Dalehurst; Not too bad (people are nice, shelters are nice, there is silver leading to 'prosperity')
Complaints: Weather (sucky), Can't further the complaints; reinforces that the 'folks are nice' (Seems there is a problem with the people here)
1/3 are from og. Grown a lot in the last year, struck silver a/b 5 months ago
Pretty balanced demographics. Everyone has a role (leads = masters (colloqial term))
Forge Master, Tavern Master, Town Master, Leader of the Miners, 
Tavern master is very well coordinated... impressive af
Pause at the idea of always being a tavern keeper. Before she was a "merchant of sorts", became the tavern keep once she moved in
Town Master stays at first tavern
Need to come to the town hall at some point tomorrow
Recommend "The False Prophet", "The Cask and Toad"

# The False Prophet
Caelin - The Tavern Keeper -> Have stereotypes / prejudices shown towards them. Unsure where tieflings come from but a popular theory is that they have done a deal with a devil / the product of selling your first born to a devil. Can create lineages of tieflings (sins of the father type shit). All resist fire damage. Believed there are ties to the hells / underworld. Viewed with speculation, fear, or reverence. Not common (1/100)
Always been a tavern keeper
Has been in Dalehurst since the beginning.
Town Master Greylan "collected" people on the road. Founded on a collective idea with the ought ideas of society. Had a brother that disagreed and started heading North.

Buy 2 Rooms for tn for 4 silver (2 beds each)
Merrick, and Gust; Nail, Vale, and Fizbit (Nail and Fizbit sleep in the same bed)
Wake up at Dawn. Nothing out of the ordinary 

Porridge or Hunters Stew (Old fashioned food. Has Lamb, Carrots, Lettuce, and Rabbit Haunch)
Stew - IIIII (20 BP = 2 SP). Paid for the group. 
20 GP for 10 Rabbits caught. Nail wants the Gold
"We All" are going to the festival

# Hunting Wabbits
Vale, Merrick, and Fizbit are chilled right away
Run into the mine when leaving town to look for rabbits. People working early in the morning with the flicker of candle / lamp light
Gust and Nail find 3 rabbits in our first bout of hunting... however, it seems we are blocked by the path and can not move on.
Another hour ticks by with nothing happening. Can't seem to navigate out.
We can move back towards the town / new hunting zone. They find 1 more rabbit (4 total)
Vale met a "person" by sneaking away from the group, looking after a fire. Makes it back to the group just fine.
3 more rabbits found as the blizzard ends (7 total). 
Finds 1.5 rabbts (8.5 total) could possibility work, Nail thinks it would still work 
Gust keeps hunting and finds hole that then drops 45 feet taking 15 dmg.
Nail keeps on hunting and finds a hole... looks in and sees a large chasm
Merrick finds Nail in a hole.
Nail hides in a bush, I hear thumping below.
Nail almost gets eaten by a plant... but are able to retrive him before he dies.
RabbitMen -> The things in the pit.
A likely human advices the squad to stay away from the holes.
Nail finds 4 rabbits (12.5) we did it!!

# Returning to the false prophet
We give him the rabbits and get the gold. 
We learn we need to go to the town hall.

# The ceremony
We are handed crafted wooden masks and must wear them of a smiling sun.
Townmaster Greylan steps on a fence and then takes a step off and plumments 80-90 feet to the ground. The wind pushes the mask off.
We hear a 'snap' before he slows and gently hits the ground as he catches the mask.
"People of Dalehurst, we have prospered yet another year. Through our trials and tribulations we are worthy of all the grace and the world is worthy of the grace we give. The sun is bountaful and gestures brightly upon us now. And we shall give ceremoney for thanking the sun for blessing us this day. Cheer my friends, Cheer for the sun. Beckons upward with a Nazi Salute. " Praises the Sun
"It is on this day 6 months ago we were blessed with the visit of the sage and seer Marie Louweed, who gave us bountiful harvest and prosperity. And we shall give back with this joyous celebration. Towards the Sun. Towards our Hospitality."
He starts walking towards us and we walk towards him in return.
He opens his arms for a hug. 
"We have new comers, honored guests, and mighty brave adventurers who have entered our midst. Let us welcome them and celebrate them." As everyone looks at us and applauds us. 
"And with this, our celebration can begin. Let the festival commence!" Streamers pop and a parade festival costume (Parade float) of a sun mask on top of a horse skull gets paraded down the street. 
The festive beast will leave town. The "beast" parades around town.
He questions us about not meeting with him. Tells us we will sit down at a feast and hear about the town.
We follow the path the seer took. We reach the town gate and are let out of town. 
The beast makes it behind the trees and everyone cheers and then walks back to town.
"Wonderous Festival", the town master states.
Nail is getting watched by smth but who knows what.
The town hall has been rearranged for a feast. Beef and Pork BBQ is brought out to us. 
People are using the sun masks as plates.
There is space inside to eat.
Nail is seen to be missing and we must explain why he is gone.
We are ready to hear the tale of the town.
Nail hears shuffling and then rustling... and then a head pokes out of your pocket. 
The Fairy awakens and is also expericing being watched.
The Fairy looks through the keyhole. The Tiefling is looking through towards them.
The Fairy stands on Nail's forehead and casts sleep on Nail. Nail is asleep.
Fairy falls asleep in Nail's pocket as well.
