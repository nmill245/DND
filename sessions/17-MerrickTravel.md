## The Night
- Merrick Experiences a dream after being scared by footsteps on the roof
- In a wintery forest, there is a very large egg. As the egg cracks there is a single black eye staring at me
- Merrick sees flashes of hunger, screaming, and other terrible things. There are flashes of the moon being covered in blood
- There is a sense of terror in Merrick
- There is another crack and everything goes quiet. Merrick looks up and there is a man looking back at me
- The man is shouting commands at a bunch of ravens, there is a thick robe and beard. Merrick can not hear the words
- The man is throwing seeds and food at a flock of crows
- The man is kneeling in front of a grave, just before he turns around Merrick bolts awake

## Merrick's adventure

- As Merrick goes to heal themselves, there is a sense of direction I feel instead
- It pulls me about half a mile away and it feels as though I can almost see them.
- None of Merrick's friends can find me
- It is taking more time for the feeling of direction to be experienced by Merrick
- Merrick finds evidence of Ravens (claws, feathers, etc). There is also a downward slope not a cliff
- The path goes down into the mist, the mist seems opaque
- As looking down in the mist, the direction travels into the mist
- Merrick feels much closer to the focal point
- The mist forms an opening to Merrick's right, there is a clearing with a single tree (Great Oak)
- There are ravens and a were raven in the tree... head cocked with curiousity
- Merrick walks into the clearing. 70-80 feet away, the ravens don't move. There is a raven closer eying me
- Merrick walks up to the very old tree on a spiral shaped hill... underneath the were raven but it is not focused on me
- The were raven is almost like a sentry
- The Old Oak almost seems pruned to have many branches, there is an elaborate Oak with so many birds
- The ravens are on lookout but I am not what is being watched for
- Merrick does not feel a threat at this moment in time from the ravens or were ravens
- This tree is just a tree, nothing special at all, not even magical
- The tree has been pruned / cared for by a person like being
- The focal point is not really moving
- I can hear Val and Fizbit as well as being attacked

## The Party

- The party does not find Merrick anywhere nor any kind of tracks or anything
- The party knowns the contruct will be with Merrick
- Fizbit, Val, and Nail are arguing about magic weapons.
- Fizbit wants Nails magic dagger so Val can keep the magic axe

## Fizbit and Val explore

- Val gets the magic dagger for 6 gold and will only hand it to Fizbit during combat
- Fizbit and Val go exploring the fog for tracks and such
- Fizbit and Val see a thing on a hill with a weapon
- They hear some crunching of dirt
- They get shot at by an arrow
- Fizbit is going to try and dodge, Val has nothing to really hide behind
- Reconnect with Merrick
- Something in the mist is pulling a bow but then gets shattered by something else in the mist
- The creature that shattered the other says "weak" before backing away from us

## Gust and Nail in the city

- Gust and Nail explore the town, quarenting the people in the town that are sick, healing others 
- Gust is looking for Merrick in town
- Nail finds a woman selling wares and then turns around not going to talk to the woman
- The woman talks to Nail stating that he seems like the one too like a good price
- The woman has many things that are "obscure" that allow for "evading detection"
- Nail now approaches the woman
- Not selling just adventuring gear but assorted goods
- Nail is getting sold something that helps him stay unwitnessed but it costs 35 gp + a trinket
- Nail trades instead 30GP the pin, and a book in an unknown language
